# Restaurant Menu App

Restaurant custom digital menu app.

## Architectural:
MVC: MVC architecture allows us to separate the user interface (View) from the
business logic (Controller) and data (Model). This separation makes it easier to
maintain, test and modify each component of the application independently without
affecting the others. The business logic (Controller) is decoupled from the View. It
helps us maintain a clean architecture.

## State Management:
Riverpod: Riverpod encourages a modular design approach to state management,
which makes it easy to organize and manage your code. This can improve the overall
maintainability and readability of your codebase
Riverpod is highly scalable and can be used in both small and large applications. It
provides a flexible architecture that allows you to manage states across different layers
of your application.
